      title: "Who am I?",
      text: "I am a determined and technology-passionate IT specialist in application development. My focus is always on efficiently achieving my goals, and I’m not afraid to work independently to deliver the best results. I especially love working with programming and technology in general – whether it's developing software, researching new technology trends, or optimizing work processes. I thrive in a focused and undisturbed work environment, as it allows me to reach my highest productivity. This independence in my work enables me to fully express my creative ideas and passion for IT. I appreciate working both independently and in a team. I particularly enjoy taking on tasks by myself, as it allows me to work at my own pace and come up with the best possible solutions. When it comes to technological trends, tools, or hardware and software, I enjoy exchanging ideas with like-minded people to stay up to date and constantly improve my knowledge.",

      title: "What do I do?",
      text: "During my training, I have already completed several exciting projects that showcase my technical skills and creativity. I am particularly interested in game development, which is why I independently programmed small games in JavaScript. These projects not only strengthened my technical abilities but also deepened my passion for interactive applications. Additionally, I have further educated myself in web development (HTML, CSS) and application development (C#). Early in my training, I began developing console applications with C#, which fascinated me right away. At the company, I then developed web applications using technologies like Vue.js, TailwindCSS, PHP, and C#. Through this, I have learned a lot about UI and UX design and try to implement my creative ideas into user-friendly solutions, even though I am not officially trained in this area. I have also gained in-depth knowledge in areas like REST APIs, databases, Linux, Docker, and Git, which has further fueled my interest in modern software architectures and DevOps practices.",

      title: "My Educational Background?",
      text: "Since my school days, I have been deeply fascinated by technical and scientific subjects. In secondary school, I was part of the MINT (STEM) class, which strengthened my passion for mathematics, computer science, natural sciences, and technology. This interest grew over the course of my school years, and as part of my A-levels, I chose computer science as a fourth subject. The topics in computer science fascinated me so much that I decided to pursue a career as an IT specialist in application development after high school to further expand my knowledge in this field and apply it practically.",
